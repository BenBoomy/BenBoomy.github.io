      <h2>Lubing & Modding</h2>
        <p>First thing to get out of the way: <b>using my lube costs $3</b> (Obviously if you want me to lube 200 switches etc we will figure it out). I have a selection of lube on hand including Krytox VPF 1514, Tribosys 3204, and Krytox GPL 205g0. Please indicate which lube you would like used for your order. If you want a different lube to be used, you need to supply it for the order.</p>
      <p>Other things I can do include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Switch Films</li>
        <li>Spring Swapping</li>
        <li>Various other mods, just ask</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Price for lubing is $0.5 per switch, unless bundled with a board. That includes any modifications done as well.</p>
